### Structure Web Pages with HTML Reflection

Hyper Text Markup Language is a language used to structure web pages. It allows users to implement headers, paragraphs, images, links and so on, into their websites. The three main parts of an HTML element include opening tags, content and end tags. The metadata tag as well as the alt tag can be used to add information to a site that isn't necessarily readable to people visiting the site but boosts SEO and accessibility. A semantic element is a tag that describes its function in a way that is readable. 

A wireframe is the initial sketch of your website. It helps us understand how the page needs to be structured and specifically which tags need to be used and where.
