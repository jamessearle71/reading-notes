# CSS Style

The purpose of CSS is to stylise a HTML project. There are three ways to insert CSS into your CSS project, namely external, internal and inline. Internal CSS is situated within the < head > section of an HTML page, whereas inline CSS is inserted directly into a single element, such as <h1>. Finally, external styles can be used by inserting a <link> element inside of the <head> section of HTML pages. 

For example, we might use inline CSS to stylise a paragraph: <p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph</p>
