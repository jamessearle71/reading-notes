# Reading 05 - CSS Style

The purpose of CSS is to stylise an HTML project. There are three ways to insert CSS into your CSS project, namely external, internal and inline. Internal CSS is situated within the head section of an HTML page, whereas inline CSS is inserted directly into a single element, such as a h1 tag. Finally, external styles can be used by inserting a link element inside of the head section of HTML pages. 

For example, we might use inline CSS to stylise a paragraph: < p style="color:red;"> This is a paragraph < /p > (spaces for illustration only).
