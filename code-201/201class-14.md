# Reading Reflections 14

Phsychological safety is a term that refers to a group culture wherein there is a shared belief amongst team members that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. This group culture offers a safe, respectful and trusting space for people to express their ideas. (cite: https://web.archive.org/web/20221125192300/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

Psychological safety may lead to a more harmonious working environment in which teams work better together, although it can also be difficult to implement in the workplace as the principles may not always match up with those of employees.

Personally, I have experienced a sense of psychological safety in most of my previous roles without ever making or noticing any concerted effort to try to make the environment more psychologically safe. At university, however--probably more so in recent years--I have begun to notice how some of my seminars are prefaced by something akin to the psychological safety principles by the course convenor. Mostly, I think this is positive, although I agree with the sentiment expressed in the article that not everyone will feel able to contribute on the same level, something that psychological safety precipitates due to its interest in everyone having a turn to speak. Personally, I don't always feel the urge to contribute to group discussions, although if it is something I'm very involved in, then I'm more likely to speak up.
