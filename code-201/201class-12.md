# Reading Reflections 12

< canvas > allows developers to implement graphics such as sharts into their web pages to better visualise information/to reflect information inputted by the visitor. The canvas element is not a self-closing tag, thus the user will need to input a closing tag in order for the graphic to display. According to Mozilla, the 'getContext () method returns a drawing context on the canvas, or null if the context identifier is not supported, or the canvas has already been set to a different context mode.' (cite: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext)

Chart.js is an open-source library, allowing developers to visualise data via various different means, whether it be pie charts, line charts, scatter charts, etc.

Some potential benefits to displaying data in a chart rather than a table is that tables are difficult to implement, whereas charts offer a great deal more visuality in terms of patterns. Charts may also account for more data that would be more difficult to understand if computed into a table. Using Chart.js would allow me to extricate the clunky table that I implemented in a previous project. In so doing, I would be better able to visualise my data.
