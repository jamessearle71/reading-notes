## Things I want to know more about

- Shorthand operators in JS
- Having had a bit of practice with arrays during this class, I'm feeling more comfortable with them, although I could use a little more practice!

Unordered lists should be used to improve readability and presentation; essentially, they make your code and web page more structured. To change the bullet style of an unordered list, you could use a style attribute. For instance, list-style-type: circle, square or disc. In comparison to an unordered list, where the order is not important, an ordered list sets out various points in a specific order. We might use this type of list for a recipe. To change the style of a number on a list item provided by an ordered list, you could input the following code into HTML:

< ol type = " I (roman numeral) " >
< li > Item 1 < /li >
< / ol >

(Spacing for illustration only).

Once upon a time, in the land of HTML, there was a box named "Boxy". Boxy was a friendly box, but he always felt a little cramped inside. One day, Boxy met two characters named Margin and Padding. Margin was a bit standoffish and liked to keep his distance, while Padding was warm and welcoming and loved to give hugs.

Margin and Padding explained to Boxy that they were there to help him feel more comfortable in his surroundings. Margin created space around Boxy, giving him some breathing room, while Padding added cushioning inside, making him feel snug and cozy.

Together, Margin and Padding transformed Boxy's world by adjusting his size and position, creating a balanced and harmonious design. Boxy was grateful for their help, and from that day forward, he lived happily ever after in his perfectly sized and styled home.

In the story of "The Box Model," Margin and Padding play essential roles in creating a well-designed layout. Margin sets the space around an element, while Padding adds space inside an element. Together, they help ensure that elements are properly sized and positioned and create a visually appealing and balanced design. (story courtesy of CHATGPT)

The four parts of an HTML elements box as described by the box model are as follows: content box, padding box, border box, margin box.

In JavaScript, you can store the following data types into an array: strings or numbers. As for the second question, the people array is valid. To access an element stored the array, you would input square brackets containing an index number corresponding to that value.

The following are shorthand operators and their function:

- += (adds the value on the right side to the value on the left side and assigns the result to the left side variable)
- -= (subtracts the value on right from the left variable and assigns the result to the left side variable)
- \*= (multiplies the value on the right by the value on the left and assigns the result to the left side variable)
- /= (divides the value on the left side by the value on the right side and assigns the result to the left side variable)
- %= (finds the remainder of the value on the left side divided by the value on the right side and assigns the result to the left side variable)

With regards to question 4, the last expression (a + c) + b would result in the string "10falsedog". The expression (a + c) is evaluated first. Since a is a number and c is a boolean, the + operator will first convert the boolean value to a number. In JavaScript, false is treated as 0 when used in numeric operations, so (a + c) evaluates to 10 + 0, which is 10.

The expression (a + c) evaluates to the number 10. Then, the + operator is used again to concatenate this number with the string value in b, which is the string "dog". When you use the + operator with a string and any other data type, JavaScript will convert the non-string value to a string and then concatenate the two strings. In this case, the number 10 is converted to the string "10", and then concatenated with "dog" to produce the final result of "10falsedog". (courtesy of ChatGPT, for reference later)

In JavaScript, a loop is especially useful if you want to perform a set of actions repeatedly, such as iterating through an array or processing user input on your live page. For instance, we recently created a numbers game using a for loop. The user had to guess a number, but only had a limited number of guesses. Thus, the loop will either be broken when the user has exhausted all of their guesses of if they guess the number correctly.
