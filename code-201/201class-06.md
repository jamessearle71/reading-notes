# Class 06 Reading Reflections

## Things I want to know

Kind of struggling with the content of this class. A lot of it has gone over my head... mainly the JS stuff.

In JavaScript, an object is a container for values that have properties. For instance, name: Ben / age: 10, etc. The main benefit of using object literals is cleaner code, i.e. shorter syntax since string concatenations are made redundant. Objects differ from arrays in that they store properties, rather than simply the index item. Bracket notation is a means of accessing an object's propery. Similarly, we can use the dot notation to access a property. The difference between the two is that that which follows the dot notation must be a valid variable name, directly naming the property, while the expression enclosed in square brackets is evaluated to a property name. The this function in the code on the question sheet targets the name property. The benefit of using the this function in this particular case is that we do not need to concatenate a string. Instead, the targetted property is reflected directly in the console.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. (cite: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

The difference between the DOM and JavaScript is that the latter is a programming language, whereas the former is a Web API used to build websites.
