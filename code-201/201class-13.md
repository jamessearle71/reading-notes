A developer might use local storage for a web application to save key-value pairs (two related data elements, such as a key that defines the data set [gender, color, price, etc] and is constant, and a variable value pertaining to the set [male, green, 100, etc.])

Sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information, authentification tokens and user locations should not be stored in local storage as they are vulnerable to malicious attack.

Local storage stores strings, although integers can be converted to strings to be stored in local storage. To do this, you can use the setItem () function on the object and pass a key and value, which will create a new data item and update the previous value.
